			<p>The farmer should choose the optimal harvest day, which is
				determined according to the Streif Index. The harvest day depends on
				the variety of apple chosen; hence, harvesting too early may slash
				the quantity by between 5% and 15 %. Belated harvest, on the other
				hand, causes rotting of the apples, and the value of the harvest
				decreases by 10% every 15 days. Timely harvest is a prerequisite for
				preservation of fruit quality. Therefore, the right ripening time
				ought to be identified, and, subsequently, a decision should be made
				on the harvesting period. The harvesting period varies from year to
				year. When defining the harvesting period, farmers should take into
				consideration whether the fruit will be for sale immediately or
				stored for a long or short period of time.</p>
