	<li>•	The Prespa Lake Basin is over 5 million years old—among the most ancient freshwater lakes in the world.</li>
	<li>•	The region is home to more than 2,000 species of fish, birds, mammals and plants. Many of these species are unique and in danger of dying out if their habitats are not protected. </li>
	<li>•	The Prespa Lake region has suffered under many environmental stresses in the last forty years, including erosion, dumping of untreated waste, and harmful farming practices, which have degraded the quality of the lake’s water. </li>
	<li>•	Agriculture plays a significant role in the Prespa region in terms of employment and economic sustainability. Over 60% of the local population in the town of Resen depends on agricultural activities, mainly apple production. </li>
	<li>•	The annual apple production ranges from 80,000 to 110,000 tons, but in some years, due to low market demands, more than 10,000 tons are discarded as waste. This waste is being dumped along the shorelines and into the Golema Reka River and Prespa Lake. There are two main reasons for this, one being the non-existence of an organized system for collection and disposal of biodegradable waste and the other, low environmental awareness among the local population. This poses a serious threat to the environment and to the overall ecosystem of the Prespa Lake watershed.</li>
	<li>•	Introducing more environmentally-friendly farming will mean less pesticides in agricultural runoff, less dumping of biodegradable waste, less erosion and more responsible use of water and other local resources. </li>
