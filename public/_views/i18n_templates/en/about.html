Unsustainable agricultural practices among the apple farmers of Prespa Lake have been proven to be a major cause of pollution in the ecologically vulnerable region.</br>

One of our key aims has therefore been to help farmers change these harmful agricultural practices and adopt more sustainable farming methods.</br>

Bringing about such a shift from traditional methods of farming is a major challenge. This is a region where so many livelihoods depend on agriculture and unsustainable methods of farming have become long-standing habits.</br>

To overcome this challenge, we realized that it is crucial to raise awareness among the farming community of the damage caused by unsustainable farming and the many risks involved if they do not adapt more environmentally responsible practices.</br>

Raising awareness is more easily said than done, especially when it comes to educating people on fairly complex environmental issues.

We have already launched a range of important initiatives to educate local farmers, including a model orchard demonstrating and teaching more sustainable practices. But the project’s boldest and most exciting initiative thus far is its latest one.</br>

We’re applying state-of the-art technology to the task – developing an online game that helps Prespa apple farmers acquire new knowledge and skills to improve production while protecting the environment.</br>

<b>The game features</b> farming practices that <b>mimic real-world</b> apple production, and <b>is</b> continually fed with real-time data from sensors installed in Prespa:
<ul>
	<li>Gameplay will allow users to choose terrain and soil similar to what is found locally and to choose the types of apples to grow based on virtual in-game orders.</li>
	<li>The game will increase farmers’ knowledge of the insects and pests that threaten apple production. Moreover, the game will feature insects and parasites that pop up randomly, informing players about when, how and in what quantities to spray pesticides, apply fertilizers, and irrigate the land.</li>
	<li>The game will be a fun and effective way of encouraging farmers to work together to increase the chances of better yields, manage land and money, and of course, compete for the title of ‘Best Digger of the Year’.</li>
</ul>

The game has been developed with our friends from the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Sts. Cyril and Methodius in Skopje.</br>

We are hoping to attract strong participation from apple farmers in Prespa and the wider region. We envision an open space, not only for gaming, but also for networking and idea-sharing for farmers from all over.</br>

So, come and play with us!</br>
